# Flower Classification with Deep Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on training a deep learning model to classify images of flowers, and was completed as a part of the AI programming with Python Nanodegree by Udacity .

## Model Architecture

The flower classification model is built on top of a pre-trained ResNet architecture. The classifier head is customized to match the number of flower categories in the dataset.

## Results

The model achieves high accuracy on the validation and test sets, demonstrating its effectiveness in flower classification.
